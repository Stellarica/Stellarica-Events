# Oxidiser
Oxidiser is a fork of [NucleoidMC's Stimuli](https://github.com/NucleoidMC/stimuli), designed to better take advantage of Kotlin's syntax features.

## Using
Currently? Don't. This is a very heavy work in progress, and has no real benefits over using Stimuli.

This will be updated if this goes anywhere.
