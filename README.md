# Oxidizer
Oxidizer is a fork of [NucleoidMC's Stimuli](https://github.com/NucleoidMC/stimuli), designed to better take advantage of Kotlin's syntax features.

## Using
Currently? Don't. This is a very heavy work in progress, and has no real benefits over using Stimuli.
Currently it's objectively worse: rampant singleton abuse, new bugs, fewer events, no filtering feature, etc.

This will be updated if this goes anywhere.
